# Countdown21game
a fun game which you will face on a *simple* AI that whoever clears all the 21 coins first wins! 
Created a two-player counting coin game in Python as measured by fully functional gameplay logic, turn-taking, and win conditions, by implementing game state tracking, input validation, and modular code organization.

Accomplishments:

Created game class to initialize coins and manage overall state
Built play_human_turn() function to get valid player moves from 1-3 coins
Implemented play_computer_turn() function with AI move logic
Developed play_one_round() function to alternate turns and check for winner
Handled invalid input and exceptions for robustness
Leveraged OOP, functions, loops, and conditionals to structure code
The game begins with initializing 21 coins. Each player takes a turn removing 1-3 coins. If a player removes the last coin, they win. Input is validated to be 1-3 coins and not exceed coins remaining. The human player enters their move, then the computer player randomly selects a move. This continues, alternating turns, until someone wins by taking the last coin.

The project was accomplished by tracking game state across functions, validating numerical input, using OOP principles for organization, and employing Python core features like functions and conditionals. Careful state management and modular coding resulted in a fully playable 21 coin game against a computer opponent.
